1. 	Java records demonstrate abstraction by completely leaving out code for methods
	like .toString(), .equals(), .hashCode() etc., hiding complexity. This makes them 
	easier to read and understand. They are also immutable which prevents systems in
	a program from interfering with code they don't need to interact with.
	
2.	Records automatically understand the .toString, .equals, .hasCode methods so they
	do not need to be defined at all. Records also automatically provide a constructor
	with all parameters, and getter methods for all fields.
