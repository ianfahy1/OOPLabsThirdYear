1. 	Java records demonstrate abstraction by completely leaving out code for methods
	like .toString(), .equals(), .hashCode() etc., hiding complexity. This makes them 
	easier to read and understand. They are also immutable which prevents systems in
	a program from interfering with code they don't need to interact with.
	
2.	Records automatically understand the .toString, .equals, .hasCode methods so they
	do not need to be defined at all. Records also automatically provide a constructor
	with all parameters, and getter methods for all fields.
	
3.	Records are immutable b y default as creating a truly immutable class, manually
	is extremely difficult. The immutable nature of a record makes them extremely
	thread safe, reducing bugs.
	
4.	You would choose a record over a traditional class if you did not need to be 
	able to change anything within that class. A record has no traditional setter,
	and the only way to change a parameter in a record object is to create a method
	with the record that creates a new instance of that object with your desired
	change. i.e. you only use a record over a class when you do not want anything about
	your class to be mutable.
